This declaration is applicable to Project: Cosmic Conquistadors of Computer Science E214 in 2020

By including this document as part of my assignment submission, we, 
Willem Cornelis Rossouw, (Student number 22823700)
Frans Kamtalele Shikulo, (Student number 22679375)
declare the following:

[BEGIN DECLARATION]
Stellenbosch University Computer Science Assignment Declaration 
---------------------------------------------------------------
 
We know that using another person’s ideas (including written work and source
code) and claiming them as our own constitutes plagiarism. We are aware that the
potential penalties for this offence, as specified in the university’s policy
on academic integrity, may include expulsion from the university and other
serious consequences. 
 
1. This submission is entirely our own work, excepting the inclusion of
resources explicitly permitted for this assignment, and assistance as noted in
the following item. 

2. Our submission acknowledges the source of all libraries and external sources
used, and identifies any other students and/or staff (including demis, tutors,
and lecturers) with whom we have discussed this assignment, as well as the
extent of those discussions. Students and staff who helped any of us, or whom any of us
helped, with debugging, are specifically listed, as well as what portions
of the code were involved.  (Note that, unless explicitly stated otherwise,
submissions or solutions to assignments in previous courses at this university
or any other educational institution which correspond to (significant portions
of) this assignment may not be used as external sources. ­In particular, do not
look at or use solutions to assignments from previous years.) 

3. We have not allowed, and will not in the future allow, anyone to copy any
portion of our work, or give them access to it in any way, since they may have
the intention of passing it off as their own work (whether as is, or in a
modified form).  In addition, we will not make my work publicly available in any
way, including posting our code in public source code repositories or forums.
(You may, however, allow someone to look at selected portions of your code for
the purposes of debugging, but you may not make the code available to them
otherwise.) 

4. We have not and will not facilitate plagiarism, such as by distributing any
written work or source code created by fellow students. 

5. We understand that any code we submit may be inspected for plagiarism
detection (either manually or by automated systems) and be retained for
detecting plagiarism in other courses.

Some parts of the code were auto-inserted by IntelliJ IDEA, the IDE used. Mostly Set and Get commands

All sounds were modified, to make them slightly softer, using audacity
